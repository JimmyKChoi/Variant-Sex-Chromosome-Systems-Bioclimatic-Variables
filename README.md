This is a project for determining potential relationships between various bioclimatic variables and mammal sex chromosome systems that differ from the "classic" XX/XY system, through phylogenetic analyses using
various R packages.

Other tangentially related stuff includes ancestral state reconstruction, etc.

**updated herpestidae stuff.Rmd** - Original (and most complete) script for this project, analyses of species in family Herpestidae with variant sex chromosome systems, plus data visualizations

**batproject.Rmd** - Under construction, analyses of species in family Phyllostomidae with variant sex chromosome system

**asr stuff.Rmd** - Ancestral state reconstruction script for variant Herpestidae species

to do: 
- start Soricidae analyses
- further literature reading for ecology/climate and its effects on sexual conflict
- flesh out Phyllostomidae script
- make data more available
