This is a project for determining potential relationships between various bioclimatic variables and mammal sex chromosome systems that differ from the "classic" XX/XY system, through phylogenetic analyses using
various R packages.

Other tangentially related stuff includes ancestral state reconstruction, etc.

**updated herpestidae stuff.Rmd** - Original (and most complete) script for this project, analyses of species in family Herpestidae with variant sex chromosome systems, plus data visualizations

**batproject.Rmd** - Analyses of species in family Phyllostomidae with variant sex chromosome system

**asr stuff.Rmd** - Ancestral state reconstruction script for variant Herpestidae species

**sex chromosome project updated.Rmd** - Script actively being worked on, new & updated version of analysis scripts integrating all three mammal clades of interest, using data from Moura _et al._ (2024). Includes single-tree analyses using _phylolm_ (phylo. log regression) and multiPhylo analyses using _sensiPhy_

to do: 
- find good statistical methods for testing meiotic polarity hypothesis
- rerun analyses while dropping _Sorex kozlovi_ or setting it as XAfusion
- make more graphs!
- write this paper already...
